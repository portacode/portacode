## 20 Fast Options
1. Portacode is like Terraform plus Ansible, but for live paired devices and Proxmox in one flow.
2. Portacode is like “Proxmox templates + runbooks,” but one-click from a single control plane.
3. Portacode is like GitHub Actions for your own infra, not just your repo.
4. Portacode is like Tailscale and Ansible had a baby, but focused on instant remote ops workflows.
5. Portacode is like a lightweight self-hosted cloud control plane for people already running Proxmox.
6. Portacode is like Rundeck, but with built-in device pairing and template-based infra bootstrap.
7. Portacode is like Portainer for operators who need scripted automation, not just UI clicks.
8. Portacode is like cloud-init plus SSH orchestration, but with task lifecycle, retries, and status baked in.
9. Portacode is like “kubectl for non-Kubernetes fleets” when your targets are mixed devices and VMs.
10. Portacode is like Nomad-style job thinking, but for arbitrary paired machines and Proxmox containers.
11. Portacode is like IaC speed without cloud lock-in: one-click template deploy on your own node.

16. Portacode is like your Proxmox cluster got a CI/CD layer for operational tasks.
17. Portacode is like an internal platform team tool you can start using before building the whole platform.
18. Portacode is like SSH orchestration, but observable: step state, outputs, retries, cancel, modify.
