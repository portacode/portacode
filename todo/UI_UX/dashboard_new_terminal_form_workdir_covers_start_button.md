# Issue

When the user tries to benefit from the auto-complete suggestions feature in the "Working Directory" field in the form for starting a new terminal session, the list of auto-complete options show under the field extending enough to cover the button "Start Terminal" so the user has no way to configm the current path unless they first click somehwere else in the form to close the dropdown, and what makes it more frustorating is that if they accidentally taped outside the form, that would close the modal and they have to start over.

# Suggested solution

Ensure the modal height is big enough to utilize the screen height so that the button will be at a significantly lower location while still being visible in the screen but at the same time offering enough space for the drop down to extend without covering the button
